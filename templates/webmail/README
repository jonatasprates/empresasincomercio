Introduction:
-------------
CnagrejoMail is a mod of "SquirrelMail". SquirrelMail is a standards-based 
webmail package written in PHP. The goal of CangrejoMail is to improve 
SquirrelMail by making compatible with XHTML 1.0, CSS standards and manage themes. Also
it includes some elements that works with AJAX to make things more easy for 
the user, but it's also prepared to work with browser that do not support 
javascript at all. 

Why did you guys create CangrejoMail? We saw the power of SquirrelMail but
we also saw the lack of css support and theme handling. Also we added other 
features that we like from other webmails out there.
